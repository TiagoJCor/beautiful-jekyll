### Short bio

Grew up in Portugal near the beautiful city of Lisbon. I graduated *summa cum laude* with a B.S. in Physics and Mathematics from Bates College, having been inducted to [Phi Beta Kappa](https://www.pbk.org/ "The Phi Beta Kappa Society webpage")
Moved to New York City to enroll in Columbia University's PhD-track program in Applied Mathematics at the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science.

I am member of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics  

### Academic interests

I am broadly interested in the study and application of optimization, machine learning, mathematical modeling and numerical methods. I retain good dose of curiosity about quantum mechanics and, more generally, AMO physics from my undergraduate days.
