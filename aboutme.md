### Short bio

Grew up in Portugal near the beautiful city of Lisbon. Earned a B.S. in Physics and Mathematics from Bates College in Lewiston, Maine, graduating *summa cum laude* in May 2017. Moved to New York City to enroll in Columbia University's PhD-track program in Applied Mathematics at the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science.

### Research interests

I am broadly interested in numerical methods, optimization and machine learning. I retain a curiosity about quantum physics and quantum computing from my undergraduate days.
