### Short bio

I grew up in Portugal near the beautiful city of Lisbon. Shortly after concluding my highschool studies I moved to Lewiston, Maine to attend **Bates College**. I graduated *summa cum laude* with a B.S. in **Physics and Mathematics** in May 2017, having been inducted to both the [Phi Beta Kappa](https://www.pbk.org/ "The Phi Beta Kappa Society webpage") and [Sigma Xi](https://www.sigmaxi.org/ "Sigma Xi webpage") honor societies. In the meantime I spent a summer in Heidelberg, Germany as an undergraduate research intern.

Towards the end of the summer of 2017 I moved to New York City to enroll in **Columbia University**'s PhD-track program in **Applied Mathematics** at the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science. There I also worked as a teaching assistant for Numerical Methods and PDEs courses in the [APAM](http://apam.columbia.edu/ "APAM department webpage") department during the 2017/18 academic year.

### Research interests

Currently I am interested in the study and application of **optimization, machine learning and numerical methods**, and more generally in **mathematical modeling** as a means to solve practical problems. I have research experience in **experimental atomic physics** and retain a great deal of curiosity on topics in the realms of quantum mechanics, quantum computing and ultracold physics. 

I am member of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics ([SIAM](https://www.siam.org/ "SIAM webpage")) and was a member of the American Physical Society ([APS](https://www.aps.org/ "APS webpage")) between 2015 and 2017.

### Beyond academia

On a daily basis my hobbies include reading, swimming, and discussing the intricacies (or lack therof) of Portuguese **soccer** to anyone who cares to indulge me. I have been lucky to **travel** to more than a few interesting places around the world, mostly driven by the desire to try new foods.
