### Scalability of parallel algorithms for large-scale optimization
#### (2018)

I am currently at Argonne National Laboratory researching the scalability prospects of parallel variable distribution (see [Ferris & Mangasarian, 1994](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/0804047)) in comparison with other large-scale optimization algorithms.

Updates coming soon!
