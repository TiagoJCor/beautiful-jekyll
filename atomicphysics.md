During my three-year tenure as a student researcher in Nathan Lundblad's [laboratory for ultracold atomic physics](https://abacus.bates.edu/~nlundbla/ "Lundblad Lab Homepage") I gained hands-on experience with all stages of Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) production. This specific project was started during my summer as a Sherman Fairchild Fellow in the lab, when I studied and implemented a crossed-beam dipole trap for rubidium BECs. I presented this work at the 2016 [APS/DLS Symposium on Undergraduate Research](https://www.aps.org/units/dls/meetings/symposium/index.cfm "Symposium on Undergraduate Research"), as part of the annual OSA conference being held in Rochester, NY. 

I furthered this line of research through my year-long senior thesis titled "Measurements of BEC Trap Dynamics", where I collected data on and analyzed the dynamics of cold atomic clouds in various types of electromagnetic trapping potentials with the goal of better understanding how BECs are produced at Lundblad Lab. Deriving actionable insights from the small set of measurable quantities in this type of experiment is a crucial part of understanding exactly what's going on. The small scales and extremely low temperatures involved create unique obstacles to researchers in ultracold atomic physics. For example, simply shining a laser on a BEC in order to produce an image is enough to heat up the atoms to the point of releasing them from the trapping potential. Consequently, the only way to study time-dependent processes is to prepare a new sample every time a picture is taken.

My first real foray into research came in the form of a [RISE DAAD](https://www.daad.de/rise/en/ "DAAD RISE Homepage") at the [Ultracold Quantum Gases Group](http://ultracold.physi.uni-heidelberg.de/ "Ultracold Quantum Gases Group Homepage") of
