### Atom Trapping and Bose-Einstein Condensates (BECs)
#### (2014-2017)
During my three-year tenure as a student researcher in Nathan Lundblad's [laboratory for ultracold atomic physics](https://abacus.bates.edu/~nlundbla/ "Lundblad Lab Homepage") I gained hands-on experience with all stages of BEC production. This specific project was developed during my summer as a Sherman Fairchild Fellow in the lab, when I studied and implemented a crossed-beam dipole trap for rubidium BECs. I presented this work at the 2016 [APS/DLS Symposium on Undergraduate Research](https://www.aps.org/units/dls/meetings/symposium/index.cfm "Symposium on Undergraduate Research"), as part of the annual OSA conference being held in Rochester, NY.

This line of research was furthered through my year-long senior thesis titled "Measurements of BEC Trap Dynamics", where I collected data on and analyzed the dynamics of cold atomic clouds in various types of electromagnetic trapping potentials. ....deriving insights...crucial part of understanding exactly what's going on in this type of experiment, given the small scales and extremely low temperatures involved (tbe mere act of shining a laser on a BEC in order to produce an image is enough to heat up the atoms to the point of destroying the trapping potential).

### Single-Atom Imaging

My first real foray into research came in the form of a RISE DAAD (the German
