### Atom Trapping and Bose-Einstein Condensates (BECs)
#### (2014-2017)
During my three-year tenure as a student researcher in Nathan Lundblad's [laboratory for ultracold atomic physics](https://abacus.bates.edu/~nlundbla/ "Lundblad Lab Homepage") I gained hands-on experience with all stages of BEC production. This specific project was developed during my summer as a Sherman Fairchild fellow in the lab, when I studied and implemented a crossed-beam dipole trap for rubidium BECs. I presented this work at the 2016 [APS/DLS Symposium on Undergraduate Research](https://www.aps.org/units/dls/meetings/symposium/index.cfm "Symposium on Undergraduate Research"), as part of the annual OSA conference that was being held in Rochester, NY.

This line of research was furthered through my year-long senior thesis titled "Measurements of BEC Trap Dynamics", where I collected data on and analyzed the dynamics of cold atomic clouds in various types of electromagnetic trapping potentials.
