### Atom Trapping and Bose-Einstein Condensates (BECs)

As a student researcher in Nathan Lundblad's [laboratory for ultracold atomic physics](https://abacus.bates.edu/~nlundbla/ "Lundblad Lab Homepage") I gained hands-on experience with all stages of BEC production. As part of my summer project as a Sherman Fairchild fellow I studied and implemented a crossed-beam dipole trap for rubidium BECs, work that I presented at the 2016 [APS/DLS Symposium on Undergraduate Research](https://www.aps.org/units/dls/meetings/symposium/index.cfm "Symposium on Undergraduate Research"), as part of the annual OSA conference that was being held in Rochester, NY.
